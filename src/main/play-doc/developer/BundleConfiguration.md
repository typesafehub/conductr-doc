# Bundle configuration

ConductR has a bundle format in order for components to be described. In general there is a one-to-one correlation between a bundle and a component.

Bundles provide ConductR with some basic knowledge about components in a *bundle descriptor*; in particular, what is required in order to load and run a component. The following is an example of a `bundle.conf` descriptor:
([Typesafe configuration](https://github.com/typesafehub/config) is used):

```
version    = "1.0.0"
name       = "simple-test"
system     = "simple-test-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
nrOfCpus   = 1.0
memory     = 67108864
diskSpace  = 10485760
roles      = ["web-server"]
components = {
  "angular-seed-play-1.0-SNAPSHOT" = {
    description      = "angular-seed-play"
    file-system-type = "universal"
    start-command    = ["angular-seed-play-1.0-SNAPSHOT/bin/angular-seed-play", "-Xms=67108864", "-Xmx=67108864"]
    endpoints        = {
      "angular-seed-play" = {
        protocol  = "http"
        bind-port = 0
        services  = ["http://:9000"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Endpoints

Understanding endpoint declarations is important in order for your bundle to be able to become available within ConductR.

A bundle's component may be run either within a container or on the ConductR host. In either circumstance the bind interface and bind port provided by ConductR need to be used by a component in order to successfully bind and start listening for traffic. These are made available as `name_BIND_IP` and `name_BIND_PORT` environment variables respectively (see the "Standard Environment Variables" section toward the bottom of this document for a reference to all environment variables).

Because multiple bundles may run on the same host, and that their respective components may bind to the same port, we have a means of avoiding them clash.

The following port definitions are used:

Name         | Description
-------------|------------
service-port | The port number to be used as the public-facing port. It is proxied to the host-port.
service-name | A name to be used to address the service. In the case of http protocols, this is interpreted as a path to be used for proxying. Other protocols will have different interpretations.
host-port    | This is not declared but is dynamically allocated if bundle is running in a container. Otherwise it has the same value as bind-port.
bind-port    | The port the bundle component's application or service actually binds to. When this is 0 it will be dynamically allocated (which is the default).

Endpoints are declared using an `endpoint` setting using a Map of endpoint-name/`Endpoint(bindProtocol, bindPort, services)` pairs.

The bind-port allocated to your bundle will be available as an environment variable to your component. For example, given the default settings where an endpoint named "web" is declared that has a dynamically allocated port, an environment variable named `WEB_BIND_PORT` will become available. `WEB_BIND_IP` is also available and should be used as the interface to bind to.  

### Docker Containers and ports

When your component will run within a container you may alternatively declare the bind port to be whatever it may be. Taking our Play example again, we can set the bind port with no problem of it clashing with another port given that it is run within a container:

```json
    endpoints        = {
      "angular-seed-play" = {
        protocol  = "http"
        bind-port = 9000
        services  = ["http://:9000"]
      }
    }
```

### Service ports

The services define the protocol, port, and/or path under which your service will be addressed to the outside world on. For example, if http and port 80 are to be used to provide your services and then the following expression can be used to resolve `/myservice` on:

```json
    endpoints        = {
      "angular-seed-play" = {
        protocol  = "http"
        bind-port = 0
        services  = ["http:/myservice"]
      }
    }
```

### Legacy & third party bundles


#### When you cannot change your source

It is sometimes not possible or practical to change source code in order to signal successful startup or have it use the environment variables that ConductR provides.

We provide a [CLI](https://github.com/typesafehub/typesafe-conductr-cli#command-line-interface-cli-for-typesafe-conductr) command named [`shazar`](https://github.com/typesafehub/typesafe-conductr-cli#shazar) for bundling the contents of any folder. You can therefore hand-craft a `bundle.conf` and its component folders and use `shazar` to bundle it. See [our documentation](TODO) for a full description on the layout of a bundle including its `bundle.conf` file.

As a quick example, suppose that you wish to bundle [ActiveMQ](http://activemq.apache.org/) as a Docker component with a `Dockerfile`. You can do something like this (btw: we appreciate that you cannot change the world in one go and don't always have the luxury of using Akka for messaging!):

```
version    = "1.0.0"
name       = "jms-docker"

nrOfCpus   = 1.0
memory     = 67108864
diskSpace  = 10485760
roles      = ["jms"]

components = {
  "jms" = {
    description      = "A Docker container for Active/MQ"
    file-system-type = "docker"
    start-command    = []
    endpoints        = {
      "jms" = {
        bind-protocol = "tcp"
        bind-port     = 61616
        services      = ["tcp://:61616"]
      }
    }
  }
  "jms-status" = {
    description      = "Status check for the jms component"
    file-system-type = "universal"
    start-command    = ["check", "docker+$JMS_HOST"]
    endpoints        = {}
  }
}
```

The declaration of interest is the `jms-status` component. ConductR provides a `check` command that bundle components may use to poll a tcp endpoint until it becomes available. `docker` instructs `check` to wait for all Docker components of this bundle to start and `JMS_HOST` is a [standard environment variable](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-bundle#standard-environment-variables) that will be provided at runtime given the `"jms"` endpoint declaration; it is a URI describing the JMS endpoint. You can similarly poll http endpoints and wait for them to become available. Note in this examples that the check parameter `docker+$JMS_HOST` is specific to the endpoint `jms.` An endpoint of `webserver` would use `docker+$WEBSERVER_HOST` instead.

#### To Docker or Not

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a technology that provides containers for your application or service. Most Typesafe Reactive Platform (Typesafe RP) based programs should not require Docker as the host OS's Java Runtime Environment 8 (JRE 8) environment should be sufficient. Bundles generally contain all that is required for a Typesafe RP program to run, with exception to the Host OS and the host JRE. Typesafe RP bundles will start faster and incur less system resources when used without Docker.

Docker becomes relevant when there are specific runtime dependencies that are different to ConductR's host OS environment. In particular if a binary program that does not use the JVM is required to be launched from a bundle then it becomes more likely to benefit from using a Docker container.


### Configuration Bundles

Configuration bundles are bundles containing only configuration values such as API keys and secrets. Configuration bundles are deployed together with application bundles. This keeps the configuration out of the application code and enables application bundles to be deployed to various environments without repackaging the application bundle.

To create a configuration bundle, run [`shazar`](https://github.com/typesafehub/typesafe-conductr-cli#shazar) on a directory containing a `runtime-conf.sh` and/or `bundle.conf` file. The runtime-conf.sh file should export any environment variables to be set. The bundle.conf file should contain any bundle key settings to be overridden. Only the values to be overridden need to be specified. Bundle key values already defined the application bundle do not need to be redefined.

For example to set an application secret and override the application's declared role, simply create the configuration files into a directory and shazar the directory containing the files. The configuration bundle will take its name from the directory name.

```bash
mkdir test-config
echo 'export "APPLICATION_SECRET=thisismyapplicationsecret-pleasedonttellanyone"'> test-config/runtime-conf.sh
echo 'roles      = ["partner-frontend"]' > test-config/bundle.conf
shazar test-config
```
The resultant bundle, i.e. `test-config-2ddf3c2453ad16589b7bfae316e6ec746418491292f874b72236741bbd8f84ab.zip` is then loaded together with the application.
```bash
conduct load webserver-015f73613aa48d397b0dbab6d7f96d687c56d72a275a5ea43d7da44a21c27482.zip test-config-2ddf3c2453ad16589b7bfae316e6ec746418491292f874b72236741bbd8f84ab.zip
```
Where `webserver-015f73613aa48d397b0dbab6d7f96d687c56d72a275a5ea43d7da44a21c27482.zip` is the application bundle.
