# Command line interface (CLI)

ConductR provides REST API which allows you as the operator to:

* query the information on loaded bundles and running services
* manage the lifecycle of bundles (load, run, stop, unload)

The API can be used by any HTTP client, but ConductR comes with CLI tool implemented in Python. To get the latest version of the CLI install it locally as a pip package.

## New CLI installation

The CLI is distributed as a "native" distribution for Windows, OS X and Linux. Lightbend hosts these native images at bintray: https://bintray.com/lightbend/generic/conductr-cli. Download an archive that is suitable for your environment and then place the resultant package in a place accessible from your `PATH`. For example, on Unix, please copy the contents of archive to your `/usr/local/bin` folder.

To verify the installation type:

```bash
conduct -h
```

...you should then see output similar to the following:

```bash
usage: conduct [-h] {version,info,services,load,run,stop,unload} ...

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

subcommands:...
```

## Packaging configuration

In addition to consuming services provided by ConductR, the CLI also provides a quick way of packaging custom configuration to a bundle. We will go through most of the CLI features by deploying the Visualizer bundle to ConductR that comes together with the ConductR installation. The Visualizer can be resolved and loaded from the [bundles repo](https://bintray.com/typesafe/bundle) using the `load` command.

```bash
conduct load visualizer
```

Visualizer is a sample Play Framework application that queries ConductR API endpoints and visualizes the ConductR cluster together with deployed and running bundles.

Some applications require additional configuration when deployed to different environments. Visualizer allows setting `POLL_INTERVAL` environment variable which controls how quickly ConductR is polled after receiving events that state has changed.

A strong feature of ConductR is that configuration may be coupled with a bundle at the time of loading. Thus a bundle can be associated with different configurations; perhaps one configuration for a test environment, and another for production. Furthermore, different versions of a bundle may be associated with the same configuration. Whatever the combination is, the bundle and its configuration that is loaded may always be distinguished from others given that unique identifiers are returned for them.

Configuration files are executed just before a bundle starts. Let's create a configuration file that exports a `POLL_INTERVAL` environment variable containing a shorter than default poll interval (which is 100ms):

```bash
cd #back to your home folder so we know where we're playing
echo "export POLL_INTERVAL=500ms" >> ./visualizer-poll-interval.sh
```

Once the configuration file is ready, we need to package it up to a bundle. We can use the `shazar` command provided by the CLI which zips configuration files and appends secure digest of the archive to the created bundle files.

```bash
shazar ./visualizer-poll-interval.sh
```

The configuration is now ready to be loaded along with a bundle. Configuration is always provided as the second param to the `conduct load` command.

## Accessing the Visualizer

Access to services in ConductR is proxied for high availability and load balancing. To access Visualizer, and supposing that ConductR is running at `172.17.0.1`, use the URL, `http://172.17.0.1:9999`. Alternatively, if you can only access ConductR nodes using SSH, create a SSH tunnel that tunnels local port from your machine to the Visualizer service `ssh -L 9999:172.17.0.1:9999 172.17.0.1` and then access Visualizer by pointing your browser to `http://localhost:9999`.

Visualizer shows ConductR nodes as small blue circles with IP addresses next to them. Green circles denote bundles, and spinning circle means that a bundle is running. You should see one instance of bundle running. Try starting Visualizer on more nodes by executing:

```bash
conduct run --ip 172.17.0.1 --scale 2 visualizer
```

You should see another green circle start spinning, which means that another instance of Visualizer was started. Play around with more `conduct` commands and see how it affects ConductR cluster visualization.

Our aim is to make using Lightbend ConductR by operators akin to using Play by developers; a joyful and productive experience! ConductR starts to shine when used in the context of managing more than 2 nodes; a common scenario for reactive applications. Go and spin those nodes up!

## DC/OS

The CLI is able to integrate with the DC/OS CLI e.g. `dcos conduct info` will render the current ConductR state on DC/OS. To setup CLI integration type `conduct setup-dcos`.
