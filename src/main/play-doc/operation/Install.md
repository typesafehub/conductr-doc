> This is a tutorial for installing ConductR on linux in production mode. It shows how this is done for a small cluster of 3 machines. If you are looking for a non-production Linux installation (for example, a QA environment that is close to production), be sure to read about [how to setup for non-production](ClusterSetupConsiderations#Setting-up-for-non-production) after reading the remainder of this page.

## Prerequisites

* x86/64 bit Debian or Rpm based Linux system (recommended: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS or RHEL/CentOS 7)
* Oracle Java Runtime Environment 8 (JRE 8)
* Python 3.4
* Debian or Rpm package of ConductR

### Installing JRE 8

Install Java 8 as the default JRE on the system.

On Ubuntu, you can use the webupd8team repository provided that you accept the Oracle license agreement.

``` bash
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:webupd8team/java
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install oracle-java8-installer && sudo apt-get clean
sudo apt-get -y install oracle-java8-set-default
echo "JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle" | sudo tee -a /etc/environment
```

### Optional dependencies

* Docker - for running bundles inside a Docker container

## Installing ConductR on the first machine

This tutorial uses three systems with the addresses `172.17.0.{1,2,3}` for ConductR and `172.17.0.{11,12,13}` for ConductR Agent. To simplify the installation and configuration instructions, we are going to use the hostname command. Please ensure the hostname is set correctly or substitute your addresses as appropriate for $(hostname). To set the hostname, pass the ip address to hostname.

``` bash
sudo hostname $(hostname -i)
```

The tutorial also assumes that you have obtained the `conductr_%PLAY_VERSION%_all.deb` Debian or `conductr_%PLAY_VERSION%-1.noarch.rpm` Rpm package.

Install ConductR as any other Debian or Rpm package.

``` bash
[172.17.0.1]$ sudo dpkg -i conductr_%PLAY_VERSION%_all.deb
```
or

``` bash
[172.17.0.1]$ sudo yum install conductr-%PLAY_VERSION%-1.noarch.rpm
```

ConductR is automatically registered as a service and started. ConductR provides cluster and application information as well as its control interface via a REST API.

``` bash
[172.17.0.1]$ curl -s 127.0.0.1:9005/members | python3 -m json.tool
```

A typical response contains the current members of the cluster (shown here as just one), the address of the node that the queried control server is running on and a list of unreachable nodes (shown here as empty).

``` json
{
  "members": [
    {
      "node": "akka.tcp://conductr@127.0.0.1:9004",
      "nodeUid": "-1595142725",
      "roles": [
        "web"
      ],
      "status": "Up"
    }
  ],
  "selfNode": "akka.tcp://conductr@127.0.0.1:9004",
  "selfNodeUid": "-1595142725",
  "unreachable": []
}
```

The IP addresses in the response indicate that ConductR is listening to the `localhost` address. To be able to form an inter-machine cluster, ConductR must be configured to listen to the machine's host interface. This can be enabled adding a property declaration for `CONDUCTR_IP` to the start command as follows:

``` bash
[172.17.0.1]$ echo -DCONDUCTR_IP=$(hostname) | sudo tee -a /usr/share/conductr/conf/application.ini
[172.17.0.1]$ sudo service conductr restart
```

Check for the cluster information once again, but now use the host address of the machine.

``` bash
[172.17.0.1]$ curl -s $(hostname):9005/members | python3 -m json.tool
```

### Installation miscellany

The ConductR service runs under the `conductr` user along with the `conductr` group. Its pid file is written to: `/var/run/conductr/running.pid` and its install location is `/usr/share/conductr`.

Logging will require configuration for each machine where ConductR is installed. Please refer to the section on [[logging|Logging]] and select the appropriate method for you. ConductR is bundled with an Elasticsearch based solution and is configured for that by default.

By default ConductR's logging is quite sparse. Unless an error or warning occurs then there will be no log output. To increase the verbosity of the logging you can use this command:

``` bash
[172.17.0.1]$ echo -Dakka.loglevel=debug | sudo tee -a /usr/share/conductr/conf/application.ini
```

### Optional dependencies

#### Docker

ConductR supports running applications and services within Docker. If you plan on running Docker based bundles, you will need to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) according to [the official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux/). Once Docker is installed then add ConductR's user/group to the `docker` group so that it has [the correct permissions in order to access Docker](http://docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux/#giving-non-root-access):

``` bash
[172.17.0.1]$ sudo usermod -a -G docker conductr
```

## Installing ConductR on the remaining machines

_Repeat each step in this section also on the `172.17.0.3` machine._

First ensure that the following ports are available between the machines forming the cluster:

* 9004 - Akka remoting for ConductR
* 9006 - Bundle streaming between ConductR nodes
* 10000 to 10999 - the default range of ports allocated to bundle component endpoints

The node running on the `172.17.0.1` machine is called a seed node, which is a node that is going to be used as the initial contact point when joining a cluster. Install ConductR on the new machine and configure the address of a seed node:

``` bash
[172.17.0.2]$ sudo dpkg -i conductr_%PLAY_VERSION%_all.deb
```
or

``` bash
sudo yum install conductr_%PLAY_VERSION%-1.noarch.rpm
```
then

``` bash
[172.17.0.2]$ echo -DCONDUCTR_IP=$(hostname) | sudo tee -a /usr/share/conductr/conf/application.ini
[172.17.0.2]$ echo --seed 172.17.0.1:9004 | sudo tee -a /usr/share/conductr/conf/application.ini
[172.17.0.2]$ sudo service conductr restart
```

You should now see a new node in the cluster members list by using the following query:

``` bash
[172.17.0.2]$ curl -s 172.17.0.2:9005/members | python3 -m json.tool
```

Install optional dependencies if required. Each ConductR node requires same optional dependencies to be installed.

## Installing ConductR Agent

Perform the following installation steps on the `172.17.0.{11,12,13}` machine designated for ConductR agent.

The ConductR Agent package can be obtained from the seed node machine `172.17.0.1` under `/usr/share/conductr/agent` as a file called `conductr-agent_%PLAY_VERSION%_all.deb` Debian or `conductr-agent_%PLAY_VERSION%-1.noarch.rpm` Rpm.

Copy the ConductR Agent package file from `172.17.0.1` to `172.17.0.11`.

Once the ConductR Agent package file is copied, install ConductR Agent as any other Debian or Rpm package.

``` bash
[172.17.0.11]$ sudo dpkg -i conductr-agent_%PLAY_VERSION%_all.deb
```
or

``` bash
[172.17.0.11]$ sudo yum install conductr-agent-%PLAY_VERSION%-1.noarch.rpm
```

ConductR Agent is automatically registered as a service and started.

ConductR Agent needs to be configured to listen on the host machine's interface, and the ConductR Agent also need to be told of the address of the ConductR node.

``` bash
[172.17.0.11]$ echo -DCONDUCTR_AGENT_IP=$(hostname) | sudo tee -a /usr/share/conductr-agent/conf/application.ini
[172.17.0.11]$ echo --core-node 172.17.0.1:9004 | sudo tee -a /usr/share/conductr-agent/conf/application.ini
[172.17.0.11]$ sudo service conductr-agent restart
```

Repeat the steps above on `172.17.0.12` and `172.17.0.13`.

The ConductR seed node `172.17.0.1:9004` will be used as the initial node for the ConductR Agent to connect into the ConductR cluster. Upon startup, the address of the remaining members of the cluster will be obtained by ConductR agent. This information will be used by ConductR Agent to re-establish connectivity any member of the cluster upon disconnection or restart.


### Installation miscellany

The ConductR Agent service runs under the `conductr` user along with the `conductr` group. Its pid file is written to: `/var/run/conductr-agent/running.pid` and its install location is `/usr/share/conductr-agent`.

By default ConductR Agent's logging is quite sparse. Unless an error or warning occurs then there will be no log output. To increase the verbosity of the logging you can use this command:

``` bash
[172.17.0.11]$ echo -Dakka.loglevel=debug | sudo tee -a /usr/share/conductr-agent/conf/application.ini
```

## Installing a Proxy

_Perform each step in this section on all nodes: `172.17.0.1`, `172.17.0.2` and `172.17.0.3`. For full resilience a proxy should be installed for each machine that ConductR is installed on._

Proxying application endpoints is required when running more than one instance of ConductR; which should be always for production style scenarios. Proxying endpoints permits connectivity from both external callers and for bundle components to communicate with other bundle components. This also allows an external caller to contact an application that is running on any ConductR node by contacting any proxy instance.

We will be using `HAProxy`. Install HAProxy version 1.5 or newer.

``` bash
[172.17.0.1]$ sudo apt-get -y install haproxy
```
or
``` bash
[172.17.0.1]$ sudo yum install haproxy
```

On Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6, haproxy is in the RHEL Server Load Balancer (v6 for 64-bit x86_64) rhel-lb-for-rhel-6-server-rpms channel. You'll need to add this channel to your server.

On some Debian distributions you may need to add a dedicated Personal Package Archive (PPA) in order to install HAProxy 1.5 via the package manager. For example:

``` bash
[172.17.0.1]$ sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:vbernat/haproxy-1.5
[172.17.0.1]$ sudo apt-get update
[172.17.0.1]$ sudo apt-get -y install haproxy
```

ConductR provides a ConductR-HAProxy bundle that listens for bundle events from ConductR and updates the local HAProxy configuration file accordingly. We must specifically allow the bundle to use `sudo` to reload HAProxy.

First, we have the user `conductr` own the HAProxy config file.

``` bash
[172.17.0.1]$ sudo chown conductr:conductr /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
```

After updating the HAProxy configuration file, ConductR-HAProxy will signal HAProxy to reload for the updated configuration. We will limit the bundle's sudo privileges to running a single script in `/usr/bin` for that purpose. Grant permissions to the `conductr` user to write and run the `reloadHAPRoxy.sh` command. An addition to `/etc/sudoers` allows for using `sudo` without password for the `reloadHAProxy.sh` script. If a more specific reload sequence is required, a custom reload script can be specified using the CONDUCTR_RELOADHAPROXY_SCRIPT environment variable in a configuration bundle.

``` bash
[172.17.0.1]$ sudo touch /usr/bin/reloadHAProxy.sh
[172.17.0.1]$ sudo chmod 0770 /usr/bin/reloadHAProxy.sh
[172.17.0.1]$ sudo chown conductr:conductr /usr/bin/reloadHAProxy.sh
[172.17.0.1]$ echo "conductr ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/reloadHAProxy.sh" | sudo tee -a /etc/sudoers
```

On RHEL and CentOS it may also be neccessary to [disable default requiretty](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1020147) for the conductr user in `sudoers`.

``` bash
[172.17.0.1]$ echo 'Defaults: conductr  !requiretty' | sudo tee -a /etc/sudoers
```

We are now ready to run the bundle.

## Loading and Running ConductR-HAProxy Bundle

ConductR-HAProxy bundle listens for bundle changes within ConductR and updates the HAProxy config to expose the bundle endpoints accordingly.

### Prepare ConductR-HAProxy nodes

_Perform each step in this section on all nodes: `172.17.0.1`, `172.17.0.2` and `172.17.0.3`.

ConductR-HAProxy bundle must be installed on all nodes where HAProxy is installed, and these nodes can be distinguished by the `haproxy` role. Assign the `haproxy` role to the nodes where the proxy will be hosted.

Append the `haproxy` role to the default `web` role as follows:

```bash
[172.17.0.1]$ echo -Dakka.cluster.roles.0=web | sudo tee -a /usr/share/conductr/conf/application.ini
[172.17.0.1]$ echo -Dakka.cluster.roles.1=haproxy | sudo tee -a /usr/share/conductr/conf/application.ini
[172.17.0.1]$ sudo service conductr restart
```

### Use CLI to load and run ConductR-HAProxy bundle

_Execute the step in this section only on the `172.17.0.1` machine. We could also use a host that is not a cluster member as our control node._

These instructions for loading and running the ConductR-HAProxy bundle require the [[CLI|CLI]] to be installed. Continue with the next step only from a host where the ConductR [[CLI|CLI]] is installed.

Load and run the ConductR-HAProxy bundle as follows. Scale ConductR-HAProxy so that ConductR-HAProxy is running on every proxy node in the cluster. In our case we have 3 nodes where the proxy is expected to be running, so we scale up the ConductR-HAProxy to 3 instances.

```bash
conduct load file:/usr/share/conductr/extra/conductr-haproxy-{version}-{digest}.zip
conduct run conductr-haproxy --scale 3
```

That's it! You now have a cluster of three ConductR nodes ready to start running applications. ConductR comes with a `visualizer` sample application. Head over to the next section [[CLI|CLI]] to learn how to deploy visualizer application to your fresh ConductR cluster.

## Starting and Stopping ConductR

ConductR has been designed to be "always on". If you wish to use ConductR as a transient test environment that can be stopped and started at will (for example) then you must become familiar with [how to setup for non-production](ClusterSetupConsiderations#Setting-up-for-non-production). Otherwise individual ConductR services may be stopped and started at will. Existing executions will be re-scheduled for execution elsewhere and once the new service is started, it can also receive new executions.

# EC2 Installation

> This is a tutorial for setting up a ConductR cluster on [Amazon Web Services EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) provided in two forms. The first uses [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com) to automate the installation. The second achieves the same result using the EC2 Management Console and ssh'ing into the instances. For general installation instructions, please see [Linux Installation][#Linux-Installation).

## Prerequisites

* Amazon Web Services(AWS) account with EC2 admin rights
* Debian package of ConductR

Prior to using the Ansible playbooks to create your cluster, you will needs the following:

* Access Key and Secret values for your AWS account.
* Ansible installed on a controller host.
* An AWS Key Pair (PEM file) on the Ansible controller host.
* A copy of the ConductR deb installation package on the Ansible controller host.
* A copy of the [ConductR-Ansible](https://github.com/typesafehub/conductr-ansible) repository on the Ansible controller host.
* Ability to accept Oracle's Java License.

## Ansible Instructions

The [ConductR-Ansible](https://github.com/typesafehub/conductr-ansible) plays and playbooks provision [Lightbend ConductR](https://conductr.lightbend.com) cluster nodes in AWS EC2 using [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com).

Use create-network-ec2.yml to setup a new Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and create your cluster in the new VPC. You only need to provide your access keys and what region to execute in. The playbook outputs a vars file for use with the build-cluster-ec.yml.

The playbook build-cluster-ec2.yml launches six instances across three availability zones. ConductR is installed on three instances and configured to form a cluster. ConductR Agent is installed on the remaining three instances, and configured to connect to ConductR. The ConductR Agent nodes are registered with a load balancer. This playbook can be used with the newly created VPC from create-network-ec2.yml or your existing VPC and security groups.

### Prepare controller host

The controller host is the host from which we will run the playbooks. The controller host should have a good, fast connection to the EC2 region we are to execute in. An Ubuntu instance running in the target EC2 region is an easy way to achieve this. See [Ansible Installation](http://docs.ansible.com/intro_installation.html) for Ansible's requirements.

From a shell on the controller host, clone the Ansible and ConductR-Ansible repositories.

``` bash
sudo apt-get -y install python-setuptools autoconf g++ python2.7-dev
sudo easy_install pip
sudo pip install paramiko PyYAML Jinja2 httplib2 boto
sudo mkdir /etc/ansible
echo -e "[local]\n127.0.0.1" | sudo tee -a /etc/ansible/hosts
sudo apt-get -y install git
git clone https://github.com/ansible/ansible.git --recursive
cd ansible
source ./hacking/env-setup -q
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/typesafehub/conductr-ansible.git
cd conductr-ansible
```

Export your AWS access key id and secret.

``` bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='ABC123'
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='abc123'
export ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False
```

Upload the ConductR installation package and your EC2 key pair file to the controller host. The ConductR installation package should be put in `conductr-ansible/conductr/files`. The file name must match the value of `CONDUCTR_PKG` in the vars file used.

Your controller host is now ready to run plays.

### Create network

ConductR-Ansible can create and prepare a new VPC for use with ConductR. Running ConductR in it's own VPC isolates the cluster from the rest of your EC2 network. If you have existing services in EC2 that ConductR needs to be able to access on the local network using an EC2 private ip address, you need to use your existing VPC. In all other cases, creating a ConductR VPC is recommended, but is not required if you are comfortabling setting up the network yourself.

``` bash
ansible-playbook create-network-ec2.yml
```

Runing the playbook creates a new VPC named "ConductR VPC" in the us-east-1 region. To specify a different [EC2 region](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#ec2_region) in which to execute, pass `EC2_REGION` using a -e key value pair. For example to execute in eu-west-1 we would use: 

``` bash
ansible-playbook create-network-ec2.yml -e "EC2_REGION=eu-west-1"
```

The create network playbook produces a vars file in the `vars` folder named `{{EC2_REGION}}_vars.yml` where {{EC2_REGION}} is the region used. You **must** add the name of your key pair to `{{EC2_REGION}}_vars.yml` in order to use it with the build cluster script. Change the "Key Pair Name" of `KEYPAIR: "Key Pair Name"` to that of the key pair name, which may be different than the file name and generally does not end in the .pem file extension.

If you chose to execute in a region other than us-east-1, you will also need to change the AMI value for `IMAGE` in your vars file to that of an Ubuntu image in that region. The AMI listed is the Ubuntu 14.04 LTS HVM EBS boot image published by Canonical for us-east-1. Other recent versions and types of Ubuntu instances are expected to work. The [Ubuntu AMI Locator](http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/locator/ec2/) can help you find AMIs for alternative regions and instance types.
 
Re-running the create network playbook in the same EC2 region refreshes the network to the playbook configuration and does not create multiple VPCs.
 
### Build cluster

The second playbook launches six instances into the specified VPC. The three ConductR instances are configured into a cluster. The remaining three ConductR Agent instances are configured to connect to the ConductR instances. The ConductR Agent instances will also be configured with an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB). The use of an ELB provides us with a single DNS name to access our cluster by, but its use is not required.

We pass both our vars file and EC2 PEM key file to our playbook as command line arguments. The VARS_FILE template can be the one created from the create network script. If you want to use an existing network instead, there is a `vars.yml` template you can use as a template without running the create network script. 

The private-key value must be the local path and filename of the keypair that has the key pair name `KEYPAIR` specified in the vars file. For example our key pair may be named `ConductR_Key` in AWS and reside locally as `~/secrets/ConductR.pem`. In which case we would set `KEYPAIR` to `ConductR_Key` and pass `~/secrets/ConductR.pem` as our private-key argument. The private key file must be only accessible to owner and will require using `chmod 600 /path/to/{{keypair}}` if accessible to others.

``` bash
ansible-playbook build-cluster-ec2.yml -e "VARS_FILE=vars/{{EC2_REGION}}_vars.yml" --private-key /path/to/{{keypair}}
```

If the playbook completes successfully, you will have a six node cluster that can be accessed using the ELB DNS name. ConductR comes with a `visualizer` sample application. The playbook created ELB includes a listener mapping port 80 to Visualizer's port 9999 port mapping.

Head over to the next section [[Managing application|ManagingApplication]] to learn how to deploy visualizer application to your fresh ConductR cluster. You can ssh into one of the cluster nodes using it's public ip address to deploy Visualizer. Use the username from the `REMOTE_USER` (currently "ubuntu") and the PEM file as for the identify file (-i). The ConductR CLI has been installed to all nodes for you. Once deployed, you can view the Visualizer via port 80 using the ELB DNS name in your browser.

Re-running this playbook launches a new set of instances. This means it can be re-run to create additional ConductR clusters. For example we might re-run the playbook to create a new cluster using a new version of ConductR to test new features. If we change only the values of `CONDUCTR_PKG` and `ELB` in the vars file to a new ConductR version package and new ELB, running the playbook again will create a new cluster using the new version in the same subnets as the previous version.

For further information about using ConductR-Ansible, please see the project [Readme](https://github.com/typesafehub/conductr-ansible/blob/master/README.md).

## Manual Instructions

This tutorial will provide you with all the key configuration details needed to run ConductR on EC2. It presumes a working knowledge of EC2 and does not provide click-by-click instructions for using EC2. Detailed instructions for all AWS steps discussed can be found in the [AWS documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/).

### Preparing EC2

Begin by preparing the EC2 network and security environment. This tutorial uses a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) of `10.0.0.0/16` and example addresses will be based accordingly.

#### Subnets and Security Groups
For better resilience, deploy nodes across multiple availability zones (AZ). Create three subnets in the VPC. Place each subnet in a different availability zone by specifying an AZ during subnet creation. Our example subnets names indicate their AZ. They are SN-A with a CIDR of `10.0.1.0/24`, SN-B with a CIDR of `10.0.2.0/24` and SN-C with a CIDR of `10.0.3.0/24`. Each subnet will need an internet gateway added to their route table for the destination `0.0.0.0/0`. This required so that our nodes can access the internet. All subnets can use the same route table.

Create two security groups in the VPC named SG-Nodes and SG-ELB. SG-ELB will be for our load balancer. We'll only expose port 80 and 443 to the world (`0.0.0.0/0`) here. SG-Nodes will be for the nodes. We'll need to open one or more service ports to the load balancer. When adding the inbound rule, enter the identifier for SG-ELB in the source, such as sg-a803cb4a, to allow traffic from the load balancer security group. Our service will be on port 9999 and we'll use 9009 for monitoring. We'll need to allow TCP Port 9999 and 9009 from our load balancer security group SG-ELB in to SG-Nodes, our nodes security group. Nodes will also need to communicate with each other. Add an inbound rule to allow port 9004, 9006 and port range 10000-10999 from the SG-Nodes. Finally, SG-Nodes should also allow ssh on port 22 from Anywhere (`0.0.0.0/0`) so we can also directly access our nodes from the internet.

The resultant security groups should now have the following inbound rules:

SG-ELB Inbound Rules

| Type    | Proto   | Port        | Source     | 
| :------ | :-----  | :---------- | :--------- |
| HTTP    | TCP     | 80          | 0.0.0.0/0  |
| HTTPS   | TCP     | 443         | 0.0.0.0/0  |

SG-Nodes Inbound Rules

| Type	  | Proto  | Port        | Source     |
| :------ | :----- | :---------- | :--------- |
| Custom  |TCP     | 9009        | SG-ELB     |
| Custom  |TCP     | 9999        | SG-ELB     |
| Custom  |TCP     | 9004        | SG-Nodes   |
| Custom  |TCP     | 9006        | SG-Nodes   |
| Custom  |TCP     | 10000-10999 | SG-Nodes   |
| SSH     |TCP     | 22          | 0.0.0.0/0  |		

#### Load Balancer

Create an external facing load balancer from the EC2 control panel. You will need to create an internet gateway and attach it to your VPC in order to have a public load balancer. We'll add an optional HTTPS protocol listener on port 443 to the default port 80 HTTP listener. For this tutorial we will map both of our listeners to instance port 9999. Add all three subnets to the load balancer and assign the load balancer to the SG-ELB security group. Optionally you can upload an SSL Certificate to use the ELB as your TLS endpoint if you added the HTTPS listener. For health monitoring we'll use ConductR's proxy status endpoint, HTTP:9009/status. This endpoint will return an OK when ConductR's proxy has been configured.

### Preparing the ConductR AMI

Launch a single instance of the desired base AMI to use as our image master. We'll use the Ubuntu 14.04 LTS HVM EBS-SSD boot image in US-East-1, ami-76b2a71e. If you choose another base image, use an EBS boot image as they are much easy to image unless you know what your doing there. Be certain to assign a public ip address in instance details to make it easy to ssh into.

Access the console of the image instance with root access. For Ubuntu AMIs this is done as the user ubuntu using the PEM file specified at launch. The user ubuntu has sudo access. Other images will use different users. Check with the image provider for the correct user name to use.

#### Installing JRE 8

Install Java 8 as the default JRE. You will need to accept the Oracle license agreement.

``` bash
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:webupd8team/java
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install oracle-java8-installer && sudo apt-get clean
sudo apt-get -y install oracle-java8-set-default
echo "JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle" | sudo tee -a /etc/environment
```
#### Installing ConductR 

The tutorial assumes that you have obtained the `conductr_%PLAY_VERSION%_all.deb` Debian package. 

Secure copy (scp) the ConductR installation package to the image host and install ConductR as any other Debian package.

``` bash
sudo dpkg -i conductr_%PLAY_VERSION%_all.deb
```

ConductR is automatically registered as a service and started.

#### Obtaining ConductR Agent package

Locate ConductR agent package from `/usr/share/conductr/agent` as a file called `conductr-agent_%PLAY_VERSION%_all.deb` Debian. Secure copy (scp) this file away from the image host as we are going to use it for building the ConductR Agent AMI.

#### Installation miscellany

The ConductR service runs under the `conductr` user along with the `conductr` group. Its pid file is written to: `/var/run/conductr/running.pid` and its install location is `/usr/share/conductr`.

ConductR logs via the syslog protocol using TCP destined locally on port 514. Debian distributions such as Ubuntu come with the [RSYSLOG](http://www.rsyslog.com/) logging service and so its configuration is shown next:

``` bash
echo '$ModLoad imtcp' | sudo tee -a /etc/rsyslog.d/conductr.conf
echo '$InputTCPServerRun 514' | sudo tee -a /etc/rsyslog.d/conductr.conf
```

### Create the ConductR AMI

With our packages installed we can create the ConductR machine image. Image the host by selecting the running instance in the EC2 dashboard and using the Create Image option from the Actions menus. We are now done with the image host and it can be terminated.

### Preparing the ConductR Agent AMI

Use the same base image used for ConductR, i.e. Ubuntu 14.04 LTS HVM EBS-SSD boot image in US-East-1, ami-76b2a71e.

Access the console of the image instance with root access. For Ubuntu AMIs this is done as the user ubuntu using the PEM file specified at launch. The user ubuntu has sudo access. Other images will use different users. Check with the image provider for the correct user name to use.

#### Installing JRE 8

Install Java 8 as the default JRE. You will need to accept the Oracle license agreement.

``` bash
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:webupd8team/java
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install oracle-java8-installer && sudo apt-get clean
sudo apt-get -y install oracle-java8-set-default
echo "JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle" | sudo tee -a /etc/environment
```

#### Installing ConductR Agent

Secure copy the ConductR Agent package you have obtained from the ConductR image host, i.e. the `conductr-agent_%PLAY_VERSION%_all.deb` Debian package. Install ConductR Agent as any other Debian package.

``` bash
sudo dpkg -i conductr-agent_%PLAY_VERSION%_all.deb
```

ConductR Agent is automatically registered as a service and started.

#### Installation miscellany

The ConductR Agent service runs under the `conductr` user along with the `conductr` group. Its pid file is written to: `/var/run/conductr-agent/running.pid` and its install location is `/usr/share/conductr-agent`.


#### Installing a Proxy

Proxying application endpoints is required when external communication to a service is required. We will be using `HAProxy`. Add a dedicated Personal Package Archive (PPA) and install HAProxy.

``` bash
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:vbernat/haproxy-1.5
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install haproxy
```
ConductR provides a ConductR-HAProxy bundle that listens for bundle events from ConductR and updates the local HAProxy configuration file accordingly. We must specifically allow the bundle to use `sudo` to reload HAProxy.

First, we have the user `conductr` own the HAProxy config file.

``` bash
[172.17.0.1]$ sudo chown conductr:conductr /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
```

After updating the HAProxy configuration file, ConductR-HAProxy will signal HAProxy to reload for the updated configuration. We will limit the bundle's sudo privileges to running a single script in `/usr/bin` for that purpose. Grant permissions to the `conductr` user to write and run the `reloadHAPRoxy.sh` command. An addition to `/etc/sudoers` allows for using `sudo` without password for the `reloadHAProxy.sh` script. If a more specific reload sequence is required, a custom reload script can be specified using the CONDUCTR_RELOADHAPROXY_SCRIPT environment variable in a configuration bundle.

``` bash
[172.17.0.1]$ sudo touch /usr/bin/reloadHAProxy.sh
[172.17.0.1]$ sudo chmod 0770 /usr/bin/reloadHAProxy.sh
[172.17.0.1]$ sudo chown conductr:conductr /usr/bin/reloadHAProxy.sh
[172.17.0.1]$ echo "conductr ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/reloadHAProxy.sh" | sudo tee -a /etc/sudoers
```

On RHEL and CentOS it may also be neccessary to [disable default requiretty](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1020147) for the conductr user in `sudoers`.

``` bash
[172.17.0.1]$ echo 'Defaults: conductr  !requiretty' | sudo tee -a /etc/sudoers
```

#### Optional dependencies

Consolidated logging is discussed further down.

##### Docker

ConductR supports running applications and services within Docker. If you plan on running Docker based bundles, you will need to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) according to [the official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux/). Once Docker is installed then add ConductR's user/group to the `docker` group so that it has [the correct permissions in order to access Docker](http://docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux/#giving-non-root-access):

``` bash
sudo usermod -a -G docker conductr
```

### Create the ConductR Agent AMI

With our packages installed we can create the ConductR Agent machine image. Image the host by selecting the running instance in the EC2 dashboard and using the Create Image option from the Actions menus. We are now done with the image host and it can be terminated.

### Bring up the cluster

Once your ConductR AMI is available, launch three instances. In this tutorial we'll launch one instance into SN-A, SN-B and SN-C each so that our cluster spans three availability zones. All instances will be launched into our SG-Nodes security group. Be certain to assign public IP addresses to we can ssh into our nodes. 

We will now configure ConductR on the instances and form a cluster. Repeat these steps on each of the three instances ConductR AMI. 

To be able to form an inter-machine cluster, ConductR must be configured to listen to the machine's private host interface. This can be enabled adding a property declaration for `CONDUCTR_IP` to the start command as follows:

``` bash
echo -DCONDUCTR_IP=$(hostname -i) | sudo tee -a /usr/share/conductr/conf/application.ini
sudo service conductr restart
```

#### Specifying the seed node

Pick one node as the seed node and instruct the other two instances to use the other as the seed node. Here we have chosen `10.0.2.20` as the seed node and will perform this additional step on all other nodes *except* the seed node `10.0.2.20`.

``` bash
echo --seed 10.0.2.20:9004 | sudo tee -a /usr/share/conductr/conf/application.ini
sudo service conductr restart
```

### Bring up the ConductR Agent

Once your ConductR Agent AMI is available, launch three instances. In this tutorial we'll launch one instance into SN-A, SN-B and SN-C each so that our cluster spans three availability zones. All instances will be launched into our SG-Nodes security group. Be certain to assign public IP addresses to we can ssh into our nodes.

We will now configure ConductR Agent on the instances and connect them to the ConductR cluster. Here we are connecting the agent initially to `10.0.2.20` which is the seed node of our cluster.

``` bash
echo -DCONDUCTR_IP=$(hostname -i) | sudo tee -a /usr/share/conductr-agent/conf/application.ini
echo --core-node 10.0.2.20:9004 | sudo tee -a /usr/share/conductr-agent/conf/application.ini
sudo service conductr restart
```

The ConductR seed node `10.0.2.20:9004` will be used as the initial node for the ConductR Agent to connect into the ConductR cluster. Upon startup, the address of the remaining members of the cluster will be obtained by ConductR agent. This information will be used by ConductR Agent to re-establish connectivity any member of the cluster upon disconnection or restart.

Repeat these steps on each of the three instances ConductR AMI.

### Check the cluster
ConductR provides cluster and application information as well as its control interface via a REST API.
 
 ``` bash
curl -s $(hostname -i):9005/members | python3 -m json.tool
```

A typical response contains the current members of the cluster (shown here is a three node cluster), the address of the node that the queried control server is running on and a list of unreachable nodes (shown here as empty).
 
``` json
{
    "members": [
        {
            "node": "akka.tcp://conductr@10.0.1.10:9004",
            "nodeUid": "-810451778",
            "roles": [
                "web"
            ],
            "status": "Up"
        },
        {
            "node": "akka.tcp://conductr@10.0.2.20:9004",
            "nodeUid": "280222358",
            "roles": [
                "web"
            ],
            "status": "Up"
        },
        {
            "node": "akka.tcp://conductr@10.0.3.30:9004",
            "nodeUid": "1503330106",
            "roles": [
                "web"
            ],
            "status": "Up"
        }

    ],
    "selfNode": "akka.tcp://conductr@10.0.2.20:9004",
    "selfNodeUid": "280222358",
    "unreachable": []
}

```

### Loading and Running ConductR-HAProxy Bundle

ConductR-HAProxy bundle listens for bundle changes within ConductR and updates the HAProxy config to expose the bundle endpoints accordingly.

#### Prepare ConductR-HAProxy nodes

_Repeat each step in this section on each node._

ConductR-HAProxy bundle must be installed on all nodes where HAProxy is installed, and these nodes can be distinguished by the `haproxy` role. Assign the `haproxy` role to the nodes where the proxy will be hosted.

Append the `haproxy` role to the default `web` role as follows:

```bash
echo -Dakka.cluster.roles.0=web | sudo tee -a /usr/share/conductr/conf/application.ini
echo -Dakka.cluster.roles.1=haproxy | sudo tee -a /usr/share/conductr/conf/application.ini
sudo service conductr restart
```

### Use CLI to load and run ConductR-HAProxy bundle

_Execute this step once for the entire cluster. This step would need to be repeated if the entire cluster is stopped and restarted, such as a development test lab._

These instructions for loading and running the ConductR-HAProxy bundle require the [[CLI|CLI]] to be installed. Continue with the next step once [[CLI|CLI]] is installed.

Load and run the ConductR-HAProxy bundle as follows. Scale ConductR-HAProxy so that ConductR-HAProxy is running on every proxy node in the cluster. In our case we have 3 nodes where the proxy is expected to be running, so we scale up the ConductR-HAProxy to 3 instances.

```bash
conduct load file:/usr/share/conductr/extra/conductr-haproxy-{version}-{digest}.zip
conduct run conductr-haproxy --scale 3
```

That's it! You now have a cluster of three ConductR nodes ready to start running applications.

Add all cluster instances to the load balancer. Your cluster will be reachable by the DNS name specified in the load balancer description. You can add this as a CNAME to your DNS zone file to make the cluster reachable using a hostname in your domain.

ConductR comes with a `visualizer` sample application. Head over to the next section [[CLI|CLI]] to learn how to deploy visualizer application to your fresh ConductR cluster.
